Here you can find a number of [ VERTEX model examples](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/VERTEXShowcase/tree/master/VERTEX/VERTEX_models) and [MATLAB methods](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/VERTEXShowcase/tree/master/VERTEX/Utils) that export or import VERTEX models to or from neuroML2/LEMS respectively.

Before running the examples in [VERTEX_models](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/VERTEXShowcase/tree/master/VERTEX/VERTEX_models) and [Import_to_VERTEX](Import_to_VERTEX), create folders on your computer containing 
txt files with filenames "VERTEX_txt" and "VERTEX_nml". These folders have to be added (be visible) to the MATLAB path. 

Matlab methods will then be able to locate the folders containing these txt files
in order to put [VERTEX export files](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/VERTEXShowcase/tree/master/NeuroML2) with either txt or nml extension. 

LEMS files with xml extension are exported to the "test_LEMS" folder which is created 
when you run the first model, and then is used later to place all other xml files.

Scripts in this folder are either [VERTEX models](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/VERTEXShowcase/tree/master/VERTEX/VERTEX_models) or import/export [methods](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/VERTEXShowcase/tree/master/VERTEX/Utils).

To see membrane potential traces look at the [images](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/VERTEXShowcase/tree/master/images) of VERTEXShowcase.

To see network and morphology export to nml look at the [NeuroML2](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/VERTEXShowcase/tree/master/NeuroML2)subfolder of VERTEXShowcase
and [OSB 3D explorer](http://opensourcebrain.org/projects/vertexshowcase).

To see LEMS xml files look at the [test_LEMS](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/VERTEXShowcase/tree/master/test_LEMS) subfolder of VERTEXShowcase.
