This folder contains a number of examples and MATLAB methods that export VERTEX models to neuroML2 and LEMS.

Before running the examples above, create folders on your computer containing txt files with filenames
"VERTEX_txt" and "VERTEX_nml". These folders have to be added (be visible) to the MATLAB path. 

Matlab methods will then be able to locate the folders containing these txt files
in order to put VERTEX export files with either txt or nml extension. 

LEMS files with xml extension are exported to the "test_LEMS" folder which is created 
when you run the first model, and then is used later to place all other xml files.

scripts will be described soon....
